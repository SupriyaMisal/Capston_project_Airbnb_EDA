NYC is a global tourist hotspot known for its museums, entertainment, restaurants, and commerce, making it a significant market for Airbnb. Through basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we aim to understand the distribution of Airbnb listings based on their location, price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors.\n",
